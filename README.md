## Introduction

**sanger-tol/zippypretext** is a bioinformatics pipeline that typically used to generate pretextmap by avoiding heavy mapping using BWA or Minimap provided required arguments are in place. Zippypretext is ideal in the case of dealing with large genome, provides benifit of being more efficent during the production in Tree of Life.

## Usage

> [!NOTE]
> If you are new to Nextflow and nf-core, please refer to [this page](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/installation) on how to set-up Nextflow. Make sure to [test your setup](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/introduction#how-to-run-a-pipeline) with `-profile test` before running the workflow on actual data.

The pipeline requires a set of arguments.

- `--fasta`
   - The fasta file before curation, e.g., `/path/to/assembly_before_curation.fa`

-->

Now, you can run the pipeline using:

<!-- TODO nf-core: update the following command to include all required parameters for a minimal example -->

```bash
nextflow run sanger-tol/zippypretext \
   -profile <docker/singularity/.../institute> \
   --input samplesheet.csv \
   --outdir <OUTDIR>
```

> [!WARNING]
> Please provide pipeline parameters via the CLI or Nextflow `-params-file` option. Custom config files including those provided by the `-c` Nextflow option can be used to provide any configuration _**except for parameters**_;
> see [docs](https://nf-co.re/usage/configuration#custom-configuration-files).
